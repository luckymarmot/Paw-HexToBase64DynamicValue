# Base 64 to Hex Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A [Paw Extension](http://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/) that converts Base 64 encoded strings to hexadecimal. This handles binary data correctly.

For example, your Base 64 input is: `AAECAwQ=` (which is the Base 64 encoding of the byte string `\0\1\2\3\4`), the result will be `hex("\0\1\2\3\4")` which is `0001020304`.
