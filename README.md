# Hex to Base 64 Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A [Paw Extension](http://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/) that converts hexadecimal encoded strings to Base 64. This handles binary data correctly.

For example, your hexadecimal input is: `696c6f7665706177` (which is the hexadecimal encoding of the byte string `ilovepaw`), the result will be `base64("ilovepaw")` which is `aWxvdmVwYQ==`.

If you're looking for the opposite behavior (Base 64 to hexadecimal), you should probably use the [Base 64 to hexadecimal Dynamic Value](https://github.com/luckymarmot/Paw-Base64ToHexDynamicValue).
